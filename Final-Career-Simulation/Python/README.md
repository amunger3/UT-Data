# README

- The Python requirements.txt is a full `pip freeze` dump of my Python environment. I am running vanilla Python without a virtual environment for this project, so the "dependencies" may greatly exceed what is actually used in the project. It is a list of every package I keep updated, whether it is invoked in the project or not.

- To run the Python file:
- It is recommended to start your own virtual environment with `python -m venv env` followed by `env\Scripts\activate` in your command line (on Windows). Then, `pip install -r requirements.txt` will install the python package dependencies as needed.
