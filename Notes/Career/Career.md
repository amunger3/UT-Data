## 5/5 Resume-building session

- 3-5 seconds spent per resume
- Most job postings get 100s of resumes
- Many recruiters use automated applicant tracking systems (ATS)
- ATS screens resume - sees if you have relevant data analyst qualifications via keywords
- "SQL", "Tableau", "Python", etc. This is how you get shortlisted
- ATS will send "qualified" resume to recruiters
- Recruiter will look at resume template, the Ctrl-F some keyworkds
- If the resume is not presenting as a data analyst or a data scentist he will close the resume
- Some will be rejected after reading summary, etc.
- Don't need to add all experiences in detail...only "data relevant" details
- Only go back 5 years (!)
- Only add *highest* education or parallel education
- Make the skill section a 3-column list
- 2nd column: add my bootcamp projects
- Upload the updated resume to Prentus
- Book next appointment

## 5/9 Session

- 2nd session
- 3-5 seconds on resume for shortlist
- Some resumes rejected after seeing template, some after seeing summary, that's how we get 3-5 seconds
- Add a professional summary to present me as a relevant resource
- Next projects
- Next experience
- No need to mention references
- Other than that it looks very good
- Remove "Career Simulation" titles
- After making these changes, simply sumbit it for feedback
- After this, a Linkedin review

## 5/12 Session

- 3rd session: "Linkedin Revew"
- Feedback:
- QuickStart bootcamp on top of "Education" section -- Done
- "I believe your Linkedin profile looks good, but *join more groups*"
- Data Science, Machine Learning, etc.
- Submit for review --> approve
- Book a job search strategy session after this call

## 5/14

- Job search session
- Even "entry level" searches on LinkedIn has "experience requirements"
- Recruiters usually don't "turn off" the position for 25-30 days even if they have enough resumes
- If there is no "deactivation date" all job postings are posted as "entry level"
- a. Look to see if job is "originally posted" (better) or "reposted"
- b. Look for number of applicants. Anything over 100 there is a low chance they will get back to you
- Indeed --> free to post on (good for startups, mid level firms). LinkedIn you have to pay to post.
- Just Google!: "Entry level data analyst jobs", etc.
- The "Jobs" section can be used straight from Google search
- 7-10 positions every week
- Add to Prentus Job Board
- Let him know when I get an interview call
