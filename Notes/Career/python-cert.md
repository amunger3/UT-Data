Scenario 1: Healthcare Data Integration
You're a data analyst at a large hospital network that needs to analyze patient readmission rates. You have:
Patient demographic data in a SQL Server database
Treatment records in CSV files
Cost data in Excel workbooks
Predictive models built in Python that estimate readmission risk
Question: The hospital CEO wants a Power BI dashboard that shows readmission rates by department, with the ability to predict future trends based on your Python model. Which approach is most appropriate?

(A) Use SQL queries to join all data sources, then import the combined dataset into Power BI (B) Use Power Query to connect to each source separately, merge the queries within Power BI, and use Python visual for predictions (C) Create a dataflow to integrate all sources, use DirectQuery for SQL data, and implement Python script in Power Query to calculate risk scores (D) Build a composite model with imported Excel/CSV data and DirectQuery for SQL, then use Python script visual to display prediction results

Scenario 2: Retail Sales Optimization
You work for a retail chain with 500 stores. Your team needs to optimize inventory based on:
Transaction data in Azure SQL Database (5 years of history, 200GB)
Inventory records in Oracle database
Weather data from an API
Machine learning predictions from a Python model
Question: You need to build a Power BI solution that updates hourly and allows store managers to see which products they should restock based on your Python model's recommendations. Which solution minimizes query execution time while maintaining data accuracy?
(A) Use DirectQuery for all data sources with query reduction enabled (B) Create a semantic model in Analysis Services, use Python to generate recommendations, and schedule hourly refreshes (C) Implement incremental refresh policies on imported data, use dataflows for transformation, and embed Python visuals for recommendations (D) Use composite model with DirectQuery for large SQL tables and import smaller datasets, then implement Python script in Power Query for predictions

Scenario 3: Financial Services Risk Analysis
You're building a risk assessment dashboard for a financial institution that combines:
Customer transaction history in SQL Server (highly sensitive data)
Market indicators stored in PostgreSQL
Risk scores calculated by a Python model
Regulatory compliance requirements stored in SharePoint lists
Question: The compliance team needs a secure dashboard that applies different risk thresholds based on customer segments while adhering to data governance policies. Which approach is most secure and efficient?
(A) Import all data into Power BI Premium workspace, apply RLS by customer segment, and run Python script visuals with parameters (B) Use DirectQuery to SQL Server with row-level security, import other sources, and implement Python transformations in Power Query (C) Create multiple datasets with appropriate security settings, use composite models to link them, and implement DAX measures for risk calculations (D) Use dataflows to integrate all sources, implement column-level security, and use Python integration to calculate risk scores by segment

Answer: B
Explanation: Option B provides the best security and efficiency because:
DirectQuery to SQL Server maintains existing database security and ensures data doesn't leave the secure environment
Row-level security can be implemented at the database level for the sensitive customer data
Smaller, less sensitive datasets can be imported for better performance
Python transformations in Power Query can pre-calculate risk scores during data loading
Option A imports sensitive data, creating potential security issues. Option C adds unnecessary complexity with multiple datasets. Option D uses dataflows, which would duplicate sensitive data outside the secure SQL environment.

Scenario 4: Manufacturing Supply Chain Analytics
A manufacturing company needs to optimize its supply chain by analyzing:
Production data in an on-premises SQL Server
Supplier information in SAP
IoT sensor data from factory equipment (streaming data)
Quality control predictions from a Python model
Question: The operations manager needs a real-time dashboard showing production bottlenecks with predictive maintenance alerts. The solution must minimize latency and handle sensor data arriving every 5 minutes. Which approach is most appropriate?
(A) Create an Azure Data Factory pipeline to consolidate all data sources into Azure Synapse, then use DirectQuery in Power BI (B) Use Import mode for all data sources with scheduled refresh every 15 minutes, and Python visuals for predictions (C) Create a composite model using DirectQuery to SQL Server for production data, use Azure Stream Analytics for IoT data, and implement Python script for predictive maintenance (D) Use Power BI real-time streaming dataset for IoT data, DirectQuery to SQL Server, and a dataflow for SAP data integration with embedded Python script

class 74 11:41 AM
Answer: D
Explanation: Option D is optimal because:
Real-time streaming dataset handles the IoT sensor data that updates every 5 minutes
DirectQuery to SQL Server provides up-to-date production data without duplicating large tables
Dataflows efficiently integrate SAP data which typically requires complex transformations
Python script in the dataflow can apply the predictive maintenance model during data processing
Option A introduces unnecessary latency and complexity. Option B's 15-minute refresh is too infrequent for 5-minute sensor updates. Option C incorrectly uses Azure Stream Analytics, which is external to Power BI and would require additional integration.
Scenario 5: E-commerce Customer Analysis
An e-commerce company wants to analyze customer behavior across:
Website clickstream data in Azure SQL Database (10TB)
Purchase history in MongoDB
Customer support interactions in Dynamics 365
Customer churn predictions from a Python model
Question: The marketing director needs a Power BI dashboard showing customer segmentation with predicted lifetime value and churn risk. The solution must support filters by product category and customer demographics while maintaining sub-second query performance. Which approach would you recommend?
(A) Use DirectQuery to all data sources and implement query reduction with appropriate aggregations (B) Import all data into Power BI Premium, use incremental refresh, and implement Python visual for predictions (C) Create aggregation tables for the large clickstream data, use composite model with DirectQuery for detailed data, and implement Power Query with Python script for predictions (D) Use Azure Analysis Services as an intermediary semantic layer, import processed data into Power BI, and use DAX measures for calculated metrics

Scenario 5: E-commerce Customer Analysis
An e-commerce company wants to analyze customer behavior across:
Website clickstream data in Azure SQL Database (10TB)
Purchase history in MongoDB
Customer support interactions in Dynamics 365
Customer churn predictions from a Python model
Question: The marketing director needs a Power BI dashboard showing customer segmentation with predicted lifetime value and churn risk. The solution must support filters by product category and customer demographics while maintaining sub-second query performance. Which approach would you recommend?
(A) Use DirectQuery to all data sources and implement query reduction with appropriate aggregations (B) Import all data into Power BI Premium, use incremental refresh, and implement Python visual for predictions (C) Create aggregation tables for the large clickstream data, use composite model with DirectQuery for detailed data, and implement Power Query with Python script for predictions (D) Use Azure Analysis Services as an intermediary semantic layer, import processed data into Power BI, and use DAX measures for calculated metrics

class 74 11:50 AM
Answer: C
Explanation: Option C is the best solution because:
Aggregation tables dramatically improve performance for the 10TB clickstream data while still allowing drill-down with DirectQuery
Composite model balances performance and freshness across multiple data sources
Python script in Power Query pre-calculates predictions during data loading
This approach maintains sub-second performance through appropriate pre-aggregation while still allowing detailed analysis
Option A would have poor performance with DirectQuery to all sources. Option B is impractical with a 10TB dataset in Import mode. Option D introduces unnecessary complexity and potential latency with Azure Analysis Services.
Scenario 1: Financial Reporting System
You're building a financial reporting system for a multinational corporation with:
Transaction data in SQL Server (5 years of history, 50+ million rows)
Budget forecasts in Excel workbooks (updated monthly by finance team)
Currency exchange rates in a SharePoint Excel file (updated daily)
Subsidiary company data in regional SQL databases
Question: The CFO needs a consolidated financial dashboard showing actual vs. budget performance with currency conversion capabilities. Data must be refreshed daily with minimal IT intervention. Which approach is most appropriate?

A) Use SQL views to join all transactional data, import Excel files, and create relationships in Power BI B) Import all data sources separately into Power BI, create a date table with DAX, and use calculated columns for currency conversion C) Create a dataflow to process SQL and Excel data, implement parameter tables for currency rates, and use incremental refresh policies D) Use DirectQuery to SQL Server and import Excel files, then create calculated measures for budget variance and currency conversion

class 74 11:58 AM
Answer: C
Explanation: Option C is optimal because:
Dataflows pre-process data from both SQL and Excel, standardizing it before loading into the dataset
Parameter tables for currency rates allow for easy updates of changing conversion factors
Incremental refresh policies ensure only new transaction data is processed daily, improving refresh performance
This approach minimizes IT intervention as dataflows can be scheduled and handle the data processing automatically
Option A relies too heavily on SQL views which would require IT intervention for changes. Option B doesn't address the large volume of transaction data efficiently. Option D's DirectQuery approach would create performance issues when combining with imported Excel data in complex financial calculations.
Scenario 2: Sales Performance Analysis
A retail company has:
Sales transaction data in SQL Server (updated hourly)
Sales targets in Excel spreadsheets (updated quarterly by department managers)
Product catalog in SQL (5,000+ products across 20 categories)
Store location details in Excel (200 stores across 50 regions)
Question: The sales director needs a Power BI dashboard showing sales performance against targets with drill-down capabilities by product, store, and time period. The solution must allow for quarterly target updates by non-technical managers. Which approach would you recommend?
A) Import all data into Power BI, create a star schema model, and use bookmarks for drill-down views B) Use SQL stored procedures to consolidate sales data, import Excel files, and create hierarchies for drill-down analysis C) Create a Power BI template with parameters, use DirectQuery for SQL data, and map Excel target data to the model with scheduled refreshes D) Use a composite model with imported Excel files and DirectQuery to SQL, implement row-level security by region, and create drill-through pages for detailed analysis

class 74 12:06 PM
Answer: D
Explanation: Option D is the best approach because:
Composite model balances performance needs (DirectQuery to large SQL transaction data) with flexibility (imported Excel files)
Row-level security by region ensures managers only see relevant store data
Drill-through pages provide the detailed analysis capability required
This approach allows non-technical managers to update their Excel target files without requiring changes to the Power BI model structure
Option A doesn't efficiently handle frequent transaction updates. Option B requires IT intervention for stored procedure changes. Option C doesn't provide the necessary drill-down structure and would have performance issues with DirectQuery to all SQL data.
Scenario 3: Inventory Management Dashboard
A manufacturing company needs to monitor inventory across multiple warehouses with:
Current inventory levels in SQL Server (updated in real-time)
Minimum stock levels and reorder points in Excel (maintained by inventory managers)
Supplier lead times in SQL (updated weekly)
Historical inventory trends in SQL (3 years of data, millions of rows)
Question: The operations team needs a Power BI dashboard highlighting inventory exceptions (below minimum levels or requiring reorder) with the ability to filter by warehouse, product category, and supplier. The solution must reflect near-real-time inventory changes while maintaining reasonable performance. Which approach is most effective?
(A) Use DirectQuery to SQL for current inventory and import Excel and historical data, then create calculated measures for exceptions (B) Import all data sources and schedule hourly refreshes, create a date table with DAX, and use slicers for filtering (C) Create a dataflow to process all sources, use Power Query to identify exceptions during processing, and implement dual storage mode for the inventory table (D) Use SQL views to pre-aggregate historical data, DirectQuery to current inventory, and import Excel files with calculated columns for exception highlighting

Scenario 6: Project Portfolio Management
A project management office tracks projects across the organization with:
Project details and milestones in SQL Server (updated daily)
Resource allocations in Excel (maintained by project managers)
Budget and actual costs in SQL (financial system)
Risk assessments in Excel (updated monthly by project managers)
Question: The PMO director needs a Power BI dashboard showing project health across the portfolio with the ability to identify resource conflicts and budget overruns. Project managers should be able to update their Excel files and see changes reflected in the reports. Which approach best meets these requirements?
