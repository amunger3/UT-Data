As a web developer and technology advisor at Munger \& Stone, LLP, I learned to deliver enhanced data management solutions by strategically planning data storage and ensuring confidentiality. Both efficiency and security were of the utmost importance at a law firm, keeping in mind both effectiveness and confidentiality. I was the sole technology advisor in the firm and was responsible for improving the efficiency and performance of all data queries as well as forward-facing outreach (like the website). Before that, I worked as a math teacher at two schools across Georgia and Tennessee, teaching a math curriculum with a data-driven approach, utilizing analysis techniques to hone the curriculum for student success.
