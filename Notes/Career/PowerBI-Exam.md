# PowerBI Exam

1. What is the main purpose of implementing row-level security (RLS) in Power BI?

    Answer: To control user access to specific rows in a dataset based on their role

    Feedback: Row-level security in Power BI is used to restrict data access for certain users, ensuring they can only view data pertinent to their role.

2. You manage a Power BI workspace that includes a dataset with your company's sales data. You create a report that displays the sales data grouped by department. You need to use row-level security to ensure that, once the report is published, employees in each department can only see the sales data for their department. What should you do first?

    Answer: In Power BI Desktop, create a role.

    Feedback: To use row-level security to ensure that, once the report is published, employees in each department can only see the sales data for that department, you first need to create a role and a corresponding DAX expression. Filter parameters are used for other purposes, such as incremental refresh policy, not row-level security. Deploying the report to the Power BI service is required for the row-level security to take effect, so it takes place after creating the relevant roles. Row-level security does not require upgrading to the Premium SKU.

3. Which tool in Power BI enables you to identify bottlenecks that exist in code?

    Answer: Performance Analyzer

    Feedback: Performance Analyzer is a tool in Power BI that helps you measure and identify performance issues within your reports. It allows you to see the time taken by each visual and DAX query, making it easier to pinpoint and resolve bottlenecks.

4. You are modifying a report in Power BI Desktop. The report contains a single report page that has three card visuals and one clustered bar chart. You need to create a bookmark that displays only the clustered bar chart and hides the cards. The solution must minimize development effort. What should you do first?

    Answer: Hide the three cards in the Selection Pane.

    Feedback: Before you create a bookmark, you need to configure the report page to show the state you want to capture in the bookmark. Visuals are visible by default, therefore, you must mark them as hidden. To add a bookmark, you first need to update the bookmark after hiding the visuals. Bookmarks can be created in Power BI without publishing to the Power BI service. While spotlight does focus on the clustered bar chart, it does not completely hide the cards.
